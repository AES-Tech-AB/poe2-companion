    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: February 17, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>AES Tech AB ("we," "our," or "us"), organization number 559507-2157, operates the <strong>Path of Exile 2 Companion</strong> (also referred to as <strong>PoE 2 Companion</strong>) mobile application ("the App").</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Processing</h2>
    <p>We take user privacy seriously and have designed our App with a strict <strong>no data collection</strong> policy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We <strong>do not collect, store, or share</strong> any personal data.</li>
        <li>All image processing occurs <strong>entirely on your device</strong> without being transmitted to external servers.</li>
        <li>The camera is <strong>only accessed</strong> when actively scanning an item.</li>
        <li>Images used for scanning are <strong>automatically deleted</strong> after processing.</li>
        <li>The only network requests made by the App are <strong>to query the Path of Exile Trade API</strong>, which does not involve user data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Advertising and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. As part of this integration:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob may use <strong>device identifiers</strong> for advertising purposes.</li>
        <li>Users <strong>in certain regions (e.g., EEA)</strong> will be prompted for consent regarding personalized ads.</li>
        <li>The App respects user consent and, if declined, will only serve <strong>non-personalized ads</strong> where applicable.</li>
        <li>We do not provide Google or any third party with <strong>access to user data</strong>, as none is collected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more details on how Google processes data, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is <strong>not intended for children under 13 years of age</strong>. We do not knowingly collect any data from children. If we become aware that a child has provided personal data, we will take immediate steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The App <strong>does not store any user data</strong> on external servers.</li>
        <li>All processing occurs <strong>locally on the device</strong>.</li>
        <li>Temporary images used for item scanning are <strong>immediately deleted</strong> after use.</li>
        <li>No login, account creation, or personal information is required to use the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated "Last Updated" date. Significant changes will be communicated within the App or via our official channels.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is publicly available at: <a href="https://aes-tech-ab.github.io/poe2-companion/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>7. Compliance with Privacy Regulations</h2>
    <p>We are committed to compliance with <strong>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), and other applicable privacy laws</strong>. As the App does not collect user data, most provisions related to data access, deletion, and user rights do not apply. However, users can reach out if they have any privacy concerns.</p>
